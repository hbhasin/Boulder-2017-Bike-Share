<div class="figure" align="center"><img src="figures/splash.PNG"></div>
<p><a href="https://Boulder.bcycle.com/">Boulder B-cycle</a>is a nonprofit organization formed by Boulder residents to create and operate Boulder’s bike-sharing program on a not-for-profit, financially sustainable basis. Its mission is to &quot;implement and operate a community-supported bike-share program that provides Boulder’s residents, commuters and visitors with an environmentally friendly, financially sustainable, and affordable transportation option that’s ideal for short trips resulting in fewer vehicle miles traveled, less pollution and congestion, more personal mobility and better health and wellness.&quot;</p>
<div class="figure" align="center"><img src="figures/Boulder%20Header.PNG"></div>
<p>Boulder B-cycle posts its trips data set on its website as soon as its annual report is released. Trips data have been available since 2010. The 2017 annual report and its associated dataset for this report were obtained from from <a href="https://boulder.bcycle.com/data-reports">Boulder B-Cycle website</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" align="center"><img src="figures/Boulder%202017%20Annual%20Report.PNG"></div>
<p>This study will explore the publicly available 2017 Boulder B-cycle Trip Data and perform some predictive analytics on the number of bike checkouts using calendar, clock and weather variables as the predictors. The reporting style will follow the <a href=" https://hbhasin.github.io/Boulder-2016-Bike-Share/">Boulder 2016 B-cycle Ridership Data Exploration and Predictive Analytics</a> study to provide continuity and similarity</p>
<p>This study has two parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p>Explore the Trips datasets and visualize the data to provide useful and interesting information.</p></li>
	<li><p>Deploy a variety of regression models to train and test the data followed by a prediction on 10 unseen samples.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="part-1-data-exploration">Part 1: Data Exploration</h1>
<h2 id="data-acquisition">Data Acquisition</h2>
<p>Data for this study was downloaded from several sources and combined using the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li><p>Downloaded Boulder B-cycle May 2011-January 2018 Trip Data from <a href="https://boulder.bcycle.com/data-reports">Boulder B-Cycle website</a>. The columns names were changed to comply with Python code best practices and only rows for 2017 were kept for this exercise.</p></li>
	<li><p>Created a list of the 1892 combinations of the 44 checkout/return kiosks. Used <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/">Google Distance Matrix API</a> to provide the bicycling distance and time between each checkout and return kiosk. Google only supports a maximum of 2500 requests a day, it took two days to obtain this data.</p></li>
	<li><p>Obtained daily and hourly weather data via <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/">Dark Sky API</a> for all of 2017. Dark Sky supports up to 1000 requests per day.</p></li>

<h4 id="number-of-rides">Number of Rides</h4>
<p>The B-cycle data, as downloaded, contained 122,331 rows of trips data. Under normal circumstances this would mean that 122,331 B-cycle trips were taken in 2017. However, the <a href="http://https://cdn01.bcycle.com/libraries/docs/librariesprovider35/default-document-library/2017-annual-report-final_web.pdf?sfvrsn=996021c5_2">2017 Boulder B-cycle annual report</a> acknowledged 103,568 total trips for the year. The breakdown, totaling 101,146 trips was as follows:</p>

<p>The Trips dataset reported 39 rows with NaN (Not A Number) entries. Removal of these 39 rows resulted in 122,292 rows with the following breakdown:</p>

</table>
<p>Removing “Maintenance” entries brought the number of rows down to 106,899. There were 1914 entries with a Trip Duration = 0. Removing these entries resulted in 104,985 rows.
Over 1.2% of the Boulder B-cycle rides (1284 rides) had the same checkout station as return station with a trip duration of only 1 minute (Figure 1). It is very likely that the majority of these “rides” are likely people checking out a bike, and then deciding after a very short time that this particular bike doesn’t work for them.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%201.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 1: TRIP DURATION WHEN CHECKOUT AND RETURN KIOSKS ARE THE SAME</p>

<p>Removing entries with a Trip Duration = 1 resulted in 103,578 rows with the following breakdown:</p>

<p>This number appeared closer to the 103,568 trips reported by Boulder B-cycle although there were differences amongst the individual membership types.</p>
<p>There were 296 rows in the Trips dataset that had “Maintenance” entry in the Return Kiosk column. These 296 rows were removed accordingly.</p>
<p>
Removing the 1,343 rows with a trip duration of 1 minute and 193 rows with invalid kiosk names resulted in <strong>103,282 Boulder B-cycle rides in 2017</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="distance-traveled">Distance Traveled</h2>
<p>To estimate the distance between checkout and return kiosks when they are the same, using the “average speed of all the other rides (nominal distance ridden divided by the duration), and then applying this average speed to the same-kiosk trip durations” was adopted. This resulted in 158,140 miles ridden in 2017 and sharply contrasted with the 242,004 miles reported by <a href="https://boulder.bcycle.com/data-reports">Boulder B-Cycle website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ridership-by-calendar-and-clock-variables">Ridership by Calendar and Clock Variables</h2>
<h3 id="ridership-by-hour">Ridership by Hour</h3>
<p>Bike checkout time is probably the most important attribute in the Trips dataset. Each checkout time was converted into its integer hour. For example, 7:02 AM or 7:59 AM would be converted to an integer of 7. In this way, total number of checkouts could be aggregated for the year and plotted against their hours of the day, as shown in Figure 5.</p>
<p>It appears that the highest number of checkouts occurred between 4 PM and 5 PM with ridership increasing steadily from 6 AM. Number of checkouts started to decrease after 6 PM.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%205.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 5: NUMBER OF CHECKOUTS BY HOUR IN 2017</p>
<p>Figure 6 shows the average distance ridden by the hour of the day in 2017. Interestingly, more distance was covered during the very early hours of the morning (2 AM to 3 AM) period. The typical distance ridden ranged from 1.4 miles to 1.6 miles from 4 AM to 12 midnight.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%206.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 6: ESTIMATED AVERAGE MILES RIDDEN BY HOUR OF CHECKOUT IN 2017</p>
<h2 id="ridership-by-hour-and-weekday">Ridership by Hour and Weekday</h2>
<p>Figure 7 shows that weekday ridership patterns are similar. On the other hand weekend ridership demonstrate a busy afternoon (between 12 PM and 3 PM)</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%207.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 7: CHECKOUTS BY HOUR OF DAY PER WEEKDAY IN 2017</p>
<h2 id="ridership-by-month">Ridership by Month</h2>
<p>Monthly checkouts, as shown in Figure 8, suggest high ridership during the summer months and low ridership during the winter months.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%208.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 8: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY MONTH IN 2017</p>
<h2 id="merging-with-weather">Merging with Weather</h2>
<p>It is highly likely that weather plays a very important role in bike ridership and bike checkout times. This was shown in the previous plots on total checkouts per hour of the day, by weekday, and by month. To verify this, weather data obtained from <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/">Dark Sky API</a> was merged with the Trips dataset and several graphs plotted to visualize the relationships.</p>
<h3 id="checkouts-vs.-daily-temperature">Checkouts vs. Daily Temperature</h3>
<p>Figure 9 shows the total number of checkouts against maximum and minimum daily temperature. It clearly suggests that ridership increased as the temperature increased and vice-versa.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%209.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 9: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY DAILY TEMPERATURE IN 2017</p>
<p>Apparent temperature, as defined by Dark Sky, is “apparent (or “feels like”) temperature in degrees Fahrenheit”. It appeared to have a subtle effect on bike ridership as shown in Figure 10.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%2010.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 10: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY DAILY APPARENT TEMPERATURE IN 2017</p>
<h2 id="checkouts-vs.-daily-cloud-cover">Checkouts vs. Daily Cloud Cover</h2>
<p>Dark Sky defines Cloud Cover as “the percentage of sky occluded by clouds, between 0 and 1, inclusive”. Figure 11 shows the total number of checkouts against daily cloud cover. It clearly suggests that ridership was highest as the cloud cover stayed at around 0.08.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%2011.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 11: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY DAILY CLOUD COVER IN 2017</p>
<h2 id="checkouts-vs.-daily-wind-speed">Checkouts vs. Daily Wind Speed</h2>
<p>Wind speed is reported in miles per hour. As shown in Figure 12, ridership did not seem to be somewhat impacted by higher wind speeds.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%2012.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 12: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY DAILY WIND SPEED IN 2017</p>
<h2 id="checkouts-vs.-daily-humidity">Checkouts vs. Daily Humidity</h2>
<p>Humidity is defined by Dark Sky as “relative humidity, between 0 and 1. Figure 13 shows decreased ridership at higher humidity levels.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%2013.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 13: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY DAILY HUMIDITY IN 2017</p>
<h2 id="checkouts-vs.-daily-visibility">Checkouts vs. Daily Visibility</h2>
<p>Visibility is measured in miles and capped at 10 miles, according to Dark Sky. As Figure 14 shows, ridership peaked when visibility was at 10 miles.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%2014.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 14: TOTAL CHECKOUTS BY DAILY VISIBILITY IN 2017</p>

<h2 id="days-with-highestlowest-ridership">Days with Highest/Lowest Ridership</h2>
<p>Another interesting data discovery was the fact that Saturdays and Sundays had the highest and lowest ridership depending upon the weather. This may be due to “‘weekend warriors’ who rent B-cycles for pleasure and are highly affected by the weather in their decision to ride”.</p>

<p>In this section various linear and non-linear regression models were used to test and train the Trips data that was merged with the weather data to try to predict the number of checkouts based on calendar, clock and weather conditions.</p>
<p>The following regression models with their brief explanation were used in this study:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><p>Linear Regression</p></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li><p>Most widely used statistical and machine learning technique to model relationship between two sets of variables typically using a straight line. Simple to use and fast performance but lacks high accuracy when compared to non-linear models.</p></li></ul>
<li><p>Lasso Regression</p></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li><p>A type of linear regression that uses shrinkage to reduce data values toward the mean. Well suited for automating feature selection.</p></li></ul>
<li><p>Ridge Regression<p></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li><p>Well suited for data that suffers from multicollinearity, i.e. features with high correlation.</p></li></ul>
<li><p>Bayesian Ridge Regression<p></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li><p>An approach to linear regression in which the statistical analysis is undertaken using Bayesian inference.</p></li></ul>
<li><p>Decision Tree Regression<p></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li><p>Uses a tree like structure to derive a final decision on the outcome of the analysis.</p></li></ul>
<li><p>Random Forest Regression<p></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li><p>An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees to arrive at the mean prediction.</p></li></ul>
<li><p>Extra Trees Regression<p></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li><p>An extremely randomized tree regressor. Builds a totally random decision tree.</p></li></ul>
<li><p>Nearest Neighbors Regression<p></li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li><p>A simple algorithm that uses a similarity measure (e.g. distance between neighbors) to predict the outcome.</p></li></ul>
</ul>
<h2 id="regression-modeling-with-categorical-feature-set">Regression Modeling with Categorical Feature Set</h2>
<p>The Checkout Month, Week Day and Hour numeric variables were converted to categorical features resulting in 44 total features for regression modeling.</p>
<p>Prior to applying the models a feature correlation was performed on all the features to see if any of the features were highly correlated to one another. As shown in Figure 21, Temperature and Apparent Temperature were highly correlated suggesting that one of them could be removed from the features in the model application.</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="figures/Figure%2021.PNG"></div>
<p>FIGURE 21: FEATURE CORRELATION</p>
<p>The models used for regression supported the use of several parameters that could be used to adjust or tune them for better performance. In most cases in this study, the parameters were set to default.</p>
<p>The dataset was randomly spilt into 70% for training and 30% for testing. For each model the training and test scores, R Squared and RMSE results were collected and summarized. In addition, the Decision Tree, Random Forest and Extra Trees models also had their Feature Importance bar charts plotted. The chart for Extra Tree model is shown in Figure 22.</p>

<ul>
<li>The data exploration phase of this study revealed the significance of weather variables on the ridership. The regression modeling phase confirmed this to be accurate. Looking at the feature importance graphs generated by the Extra Trees and Random Forest models, the weather attributes rank the highest.</li>
<li>The non-linear regression models performed better than the linear models. In particular, even with a reduced feature set, the non-linear models such as the Extra Trees and the Random Forest were the best performers with R Squared values well above 0.87.</li>
