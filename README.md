[Boulder B-cycle](https://Boulder.bcycle.com/) is a nonprofit organization formed by Boulder residents to create and operate Boulder’s bike-sharing program on a not-for-profit, financially sustainable basis. Its mission is to “implement and operate a community-supported bike-share program that provides Boulder’s residents, commuters and visitors with an environmentally friendly, financially sustainable, and affordable transportation option that’s ideal for short trips resulting in fewer vehicle miles traveled, less pollution and congestion, more personal mobility and better health and wellness.”
